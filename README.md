## Self Assessment
Based on the provided evaluation rubric, I assess my project at a **3.75** average score. Details of each score are below.

| Score | Evaluation Metric | Specific Notes |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 3 | Functionality | Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods are successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt CLI interfaces successfully implemented. Did not attempt the `cracking` method and CLI so that I could focus on the quality of other metrics in the project in the limited time. |
